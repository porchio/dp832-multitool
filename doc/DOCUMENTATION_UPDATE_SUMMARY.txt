KEY FEATURES DOCUMENTED
========================

Remote Control Interface
-------------------------
1. Keyboard Controls:
   - ↑/↓ : Select channel
   - V   : Edit voltage
   - C   : Edit current
   - SPACE: Toggle output
   - A   : Enable all channels
   - R   : Refresh measurements
   - L   : Clear event log
   - S   : Clear SCPI log
   - Q   : Quit

2. Visual Features:
   - Color-coded display
   - Selected channel highlighting
   - Output status indicators (● ON / ○ OFF)
   - Real-time measurements
   - Split log windows

3. Logging:
   - Event log (user actions, system events)
   - SCPI log (commands sent/received)
   - Persistent log files with timestamps
   - Auto-scrolling display

4. Communication Optimization:
   - No unnecessary channel switching

   - APPL command for settings
   - Batched updates every 2 seconds
   - Immediate updates after user changes

VALIDATION
==========

All documentation files validated with Python docutils:
- README.rst: OK
- QUICK_START.rst: OK
- ARCHITECTURE.rst: OK
- index.rst: OK
- REMOTE_CONTROL.rst: OK

FORMAT COMPLIANCE
=================

All documentation follows reStructuredText format:
✓ Proper section hierarchy (=, -, ~, ^)
✓ Code blocks with syntax highlighting
✓ Tables with proper formatting
✓ Lists (bullet and numbered)
✓ Cross-references using :doc: role
✓ Consistent indentation
✓ Proper escape sequences

USAGE
=====

Users can now:
1. Read README.rst for overview of both tools
2. Use QUICK_START.rst for immediate usage of either tool
3. Read REMOTE_CONTROL.rst for complete remote control guide
4. Read ARCHITECTURE.rst for technical details
5. Browse index.rst for navigation

Build documentation with Sphinx:
  make html        # Generate HTML documentation
  make latexpdf    # Generate PDF documentation
  
View documentation:
  - HTML: _build/html/index.html
  - PDF: _build/latex/dp832-multitool.pdf

CONCLUSION
==========

All documentation has been successfully updated to reflect the current state
